Algebraic equation

Algebraic equation, statement of the equality of two expressions formulated by applying to
a set of variables the algebraic operations, namely, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,
raising to a power, and extraction of a root. Examples are x3 + 1 and (y4x2+2xy-y)/(x-1) = 12.
An important special case of such equation is that of polynomial equation, expression of the
form axn + bxn-1 + ... + gx + h = k. They have as many solution as their degree (n). and the
trigonometric function, are said to be transcendental.
