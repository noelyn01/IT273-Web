Chemical Compound

A chemical compound is a chemical substance consisting of two or more different chemically
bonded chemical elements, with a fixed ratio determining the composition.

The ratio of each element is usually expressed by chemical formula.

For example, water (H2O) is a compound consisting of two hydrongen atoms bonded to an oxygen
atom.

the atom within a compound can be held together by a variety of interaction, ranging from
covalents bonds to electrostatic forces in ionic bonds.

A continuum of bond polarities exist between the purely covalent bond (as in H2) and ionic bonds.
for example H2O is held by polar cavalent bonds.

Sodium chloride is an example of an ionic compound.
