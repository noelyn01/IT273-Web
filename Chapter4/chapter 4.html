<br>
<b>Algebraic equation</b>, statement of the equality of two expressions formulated
by applying to a set of variables the algebraic operations, namely, addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, division, raising to a power, and extraction of a root.
Examples are x<sup>3</sup> + 1 and <i>(y<sup>4</sup>x<sup>2</sup> + 2xy – y)/(x – 1)</i> = 12. An important special case of
such equations is that of polynomial equations, expressions of the form <i>axn + bxn − 1 + … + gx + h = k</i>. 
They have as many solutions as their degree (n), and the search for their solutions stimulated much of the 
development of classical and modern algebra. Equations like x sin (x) = c that involve nonalgebraic operations,
such as logarithms or trigonometric functions, are said to be transcendental.

A <b>Chemical compound</b> is a chemical subtance consisting of two more diffrent chemically bonded chemical elements, 
with a fixed ratio determining the composition.
</br>
<br>The ratio of each element is usually expressed by chemical formula.</br>
<br>For example,water (H<sub>2</sub>O) is a compound consisting of two hydrogen atoms bonded to an oxygen atom.</br>
<br>The atoms within a compound can be held together by a variety of interactions, ranging from covalent
 bonds to electrostatic forces in ionic bonds.</br>
<br>A continuum of bond polarities exist between the purely covalent bond(as in H2) and ionic bonds.</br>
<br>For example, H<sub>2</sub>O is held together by the polar covalent bonds.</br>
<br>Sodium chloride is an example of an ionic compound.</br></p></pre>
